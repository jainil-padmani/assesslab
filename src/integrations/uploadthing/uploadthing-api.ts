// This file simulates the server-side component needed for a full UploadThing integration
// In a real deployment, this would be a server-side API route

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";
import { ourFileRouter } from "./uploadthing";

// Export handler to be used in serverless functions
// Note: In a real production environment, you'd use this in a server-side route
export const uploadthingHandler = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});

// For client-side usage, we don't need to export GET and POST methods directly
// This is a placeholder for when you move to a proper backend
