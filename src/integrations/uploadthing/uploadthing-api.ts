// This file simulates the server-side component needed for a full UploadThing integration
// In a real deployment, this would be a server-side API route

import { createNextRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";
import { ourFileRouter } from "./uploadthing";

// Export handler to be used in serverless functions
export const uploadthingHandler = createNextRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,

// For client-side usage, we don't need to export GET and POST methods directly
// This is a placeholder for when you move to a proper Next.js backend
